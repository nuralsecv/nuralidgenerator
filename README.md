# nuralidgenerator
This script is a beta version of an ID generator API that allows users to select a gender and a country to generate a random name. The script currently supports male and female name generation for Morocco (MA) and the United States (US). It uses basic input validation, system commands, and randomization to simulate a simple ID generation process.
